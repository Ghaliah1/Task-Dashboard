    <!-- the issues is even worse , the steps still not included in the goal box! its far away from it not to mention that the add step button and text box are shown in page with the css styles before the goal inserted ? thats the isssue i told you about u supposed to fix it already, and why is the check box list is above the step textbox? when i add the steps its supposed to be added down the steps textbox and button! and the flex not helping whenever i add a goal its add as column.. at least do what i asked 1- the steps is available in the page and not in the goal box , so as i said million of times already , the goals is good for now awsome but ! the steps textbox and add step button needs to be generated (with) the goals . user add goal<goal be added in a box and a delete button < plus, a textbox that has a placeholder " add your goal steps " and a button has " add step" content < user enter steps and add them <steps will be insertes as a checklist it willbe added as a list and whenever the user finish the step he would press check and the step will be checked , so the problems with steps are(it should not be shown in the page seperatly from goal box and even not existing befor it , and the checklist should be provided ) 2- the other issue , when adding a second goal everything becomes a mess the goals become a columns and ruin all the styles , i want them to be add next to each other , 3 goal boxes in a row , when a fourth goal is added then it will be inserted as the first goal in the second row , make it with css or js whatever is the best .pls fix all the issues and provide the whole code for each one after fixing it -->
